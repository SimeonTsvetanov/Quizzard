## Quizzard Project Charter & Workflow Guide

### 1. Project Rules & Standards

- **Framework:** React (web) / React Native (future), TypeScript
- **UI:** Google Material Design (MUI), no custom UI libraries unless essential
- **Styling:**
  - All global and component styles must be defined before feature development
  - Light and dark themes must be fully implemented and switchable
  - Pixel-perfect, device-consistent appearance (strict responsive rules)
  - Use only built-in or native solutions; avoid unnecessary dependencies
  - Footer and header must be fully responsive and accessible on all devices
  - Main menu and landing page buttons must never overflow viewport on any device
  - MUI modal backdrops (Drawer, Dialog, etc.) must have a subtle blur (1.5px) for focus effect
  - **Header must remain sticky at the top of the viewport at all times.**
    - No ancestor of the AppBar (including #root) may have `overflow-x: hidden` or `overflow: hidden`—these must only be set on `html` and `body` to preserve sticky/fixed positioning.
  - **Back button requirements:**
    - About, Privacy, Terms, and Contact pages must display a native MUI IconButton (ArrowBackIcon) above the page heading, not in the header.
    - The back button must be icon-only (no text), accessible, and use React Router's navigation (navigate(-1)).
    - The back button must be styled using only native MUI props and be visually consistent with Material Design best practices.
    - The back button must not appear on other pages or in the header.
- **Structure:**
  - Each main tool (Random Team Generator, Points Counter, etc.) is a separate feature/project
  - Landing page (main) lists all tools as primary navigation/entry points
  - Footer must include copyright, navigation, social, and support links
- **Hosting:**
  - Hosted on GitHub Pages with SPA support (404.html redirect handling)
  - Uses build + deployment method (main branch → gh-pages branch)
  - Never upload built files to main branch (source code only)
  - Auto-update via GitHub Actions (to be set up)
  - Configured for `/Quizzard/` base path deployment
- **Routing:**
  - React Router (BrowserRouter) for professional URL handling
  - GitHub Pages SPA configuration with redirect support
  - Clean URLs without hash fragments (e.g., `/about` instead of `#about`)
- **Database:**
  - Plan for persistent storage (Points Counter, future features)
  - Use local storage or IndexedDB for now; design for easy migration
- **Terminal/Automation:**
  - Do not use `&&` to chain commands in terminal scripts or documentation. Use separate lines or platform-appropriate alternatives for cross-platform compatibility.

### 3. Main Points & Priorities

- Professional, minimal, and consistent UI/UX
- All styles and themes ready before features
- No unnecessary dependencies or folders
- Device consistency is mandatory
- Landing page is the current focus
- Footer and header must always be accessible and responsive
- All overlays (Drawer, Dialog, etc.) must blur background for focus

### 4. Change Log / Decisions

- **2025-06-04:** Project charter created. Decided to focus on landing page and tool placeholders first. All styles/themes must be ready before feature work.
- **2025-06-04:** Initialized git, created private GitHub repo, and pushed code. Local development and private remote workflow established. Will make public and enable GitHub Pages when ready.
- **2025-06-04:** Implemented global MUI backdrop blur (1.5px) for all modals/drawers. Fixed main menu button overflow on mobile. Footer now includes copyright, navigation, GitHub, and support links, and is fully responsive.
- **2025-06-04:** **MAJOR MIGRATION** - Migrated from custom hash-based routing to React Router (BrowserRouter) for professional URL handling. Updated all navigation components (Header, Footer, Home) to use React Router Link components. Configured GitHub Pages SPA support with 404.html redirect handling. Removed legacy Router.tsx component. All URLs now use clean paths (e.g., `/about` instead of `#about`). **MIGRATION COMPLETE** - Application is now ready for GitHub Pages deployment with professional routing.
- **2025-06-04:** **LOGO & FAVICON UPDATE** - Updated application logo throughout the app. Implemented new quizzard-logo.png in header, footer, and favicon. Added PWA manifest.json with proper icon configuration. Enhanced favicon meta tags with multiple sizes for better browser support and optimal space usage. Fixed mobile responsiveness issues after router migration.
- **2025-06-05:** **MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS PERFECTED** - Comprehensive mobile responsiveness fix eliminating horizontal overflow issues on all devices. Implemented pixel-perfect MUI responsive design following strict protocols. All viewport constraints now properly enforced with no horizontal scrolling required on any screen size.
- **2025-06-05:** **LOGO SIZING PERFECTED** - Applied MUI-recommended logo sizing (40px/48px mobile/desktop for Header, 32px/36px for Footer) to eliminate persistent bottom cropping issue. Logo now displays in full without visual cutoff while maintaining proper aspect ratio and responsive design. Final logo implementation deployed to GitHub Pages successfully.
- **2025-06-05:** **GOOGLE MATERIAL DESIGN PALETTE ADOPTED** - Migrated from custom color palette to Google Material Design colors for better accessibility, consistency, and professional appearance. Applied proper light/dark theme variants following Material Design guidelines. Header now uses Google Blue (#1976D2 light, #64B5F6 dark) for improved visual hierarchy and brand consistency.
- **2025-06-05:** **DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW DOCUMENTED** - Clarified GitHub Pages deployment strategy using build + deploy method (main → gh-pages). Main branch contains source code only, gh-pages serves optimized production builds. Never upload built files to main branch to maintain clean repository and professional workflow.
- **2025-06-06:** **STICKY HEADER REQUIREMENTS DEFINED** - Specified that the header must remain sticky at the top of the viewport at all times. No ancestor of the AppBar (including #root) may have `overflow-x: hidden` or `overflow: hidden`—these must only be set on `html` and `body` to preserve sticky/fixed positioning.
- **2025-06-06:** **BACK BUTTON REQUIREMENTS DEFINED** - About, Privacy, Terms, and Contact pages must display a native MUI IconButton (ArrowBackIcon) above the page heading, not in the header. The back button must be icon-only (no text), accessible, and use React Router's navigation (navigate(-1)). The back button must be styled using only native MUI props and be visually consistent with Material Design best practices. The back button must not appear on other pages or in the header.
- **2025-06-06:** **ROUTING MIGRATION & WORKFLOW CLARIFIED** - Documented the migration from custom hash-based routing to React Router's BrowserRouter. Added detailed workflow for pushing to main and deploying to GitHub Pages, including best practices and common mistakes to avoid. Explained why React Router is now used and why it is preferred for Quizzard.
- **2025-06-05:** **HEADER COLOR MATCHES BODY** - Updated the header (AppBar) background color to match the main body background color in both light and dark mode (`#FAFAFA` for light, `#121212` for dark) for improved visual consistency. This is now live in the app and will be visible after deployment.
- **2025-06-05:** **MOBILE THEME SWITCH UX IMPROVED** - The theme switch button in the mobile hamburger menu now closes the drawer when toggled and no longer shows a focus border when clicked or focused. This provides a cleaner and more intuitive user experience on mobile.
- **2025-06-05:** **THEME PERSISTENCE IMPLEMENTED** - Theme selection is now saved in localStorage under the key `user-settings-theme-selection`. The app restores the user's last theme choice on reload, following MUI and React best practices. This improves user experience and accessibility across sessions.
- **2025-06-05:** **PWA FULLSCREEN MODE ENABLED** - Updated `manifest.json` to use `"display": "fullscreen"`, enabling true fullscreen mode for the installed PWA on Android and other platforms. This is a native PWA feature and does not affect routing or deployment.
- **2025-06-05:** **THEME SELECTION DIALOG, PERSISTENCE, AND PWA FULLSCREEN** - Refactored new theme switch to use an accessible MUI Dialog for theme selection (Light, Dark, System) with focus trap and backdrop blur. Implemented theme persistence using localStorage (`user-settings-theme-selection`), restoring the user's last theme choice on reload. Added a "System" theme option that follows the OS/browser preference. Updated `manifest.json` to enable PWA fullscreen mode. All changes documented here, committed to GitHub main, and deployed to GitHub Pages. Users can preview changes locally before finalizing. This ensures a modern, accessible, and professional theming experience across devices and platforms.
- **2025-06-05:** **DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW FIXED** - Updated `.github/workflows/pages.yml` to trigger on pushes to `main` and automatically build and deploy to the `gh-pages` branch. Fixed permissions to `contents: write` to allow the workflow to push to the `gh-pages` branch. This ensures the workflow runs automatically after each main branch update, builds the app, and deploys the production build to GitHub Pages. This follows best practices for static site deployment on GitHub Pages. Manual deploys to `gh-pages` are no longer needed; deployment is now fully automated and reliable.

## Routing Migration & Deployment Workflow (2025-06-06)

### Routing System: From Custom Hash to React Router

- **Previous system:** Custom hash-based routing (URLs like `/#about`).
- **Current system:** React Router's `BrowserRouter` (URLs like `/about`).
- **Why migrate?**
  - Clean, professional URLs (no hash fragments).
  - Better user experience: browser navigation, sharing, and bookmarking work as expected.
  - SPA support on GitHub Pages with `404.html` redirect.
  - Easier to scale, maintain, and integrate with MUI and modern React features.
  - Industry standard for React apps.
- **Result:**
  - All navigation uses React Router's `<Link>` or `navigate()`.
  - No more hash URLs; all routes are clean and professional.
  - SPA works on GitHub Pages with direct links and refreshes.

### Best Practices: Pushing to Main & Deploying to GitHub Pages

#### Pushing to Main (Source Code Only)

- Only push source code, documentation, and config files to main. **Never push built files** (like `dist` or `build`).
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Commit often, but only push when code is working or a feature is complete.
- Always update `PROJECT-CHARTER.md` with new rules, changes, or decisions before pushing.
- Typical steps:
  1. Make and test changes locally.
  2. Stage changes: `git add .`
  3. Commit: `git commit -m "Describe what you changed"`
  4. Push: `git push origin main`

#### Deploying to GitHub Pages (Production Build)

- Use the `gh-pages` npm package to automate deployment.
- Only deploy the production build (the optimized output, usually in `dist` or `build`).
- The main branch should never contain built files—keep it clean for source code only.
- Deployment script builds the app and pushes the result to the `gh-pages` branch.
- Typical steps:
  1. Build the app: `npm run build`
  2. Deploy: `npm run deploy` (uses `gh-pages` to push `dist` to `gh-pages` branch)
- Result: App is live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/Quizzard/`

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Accidentally pushing the `dist` or `build` folder to main.
- Editing files directly in the `gh-pages` branch.
- Forgetting to update documentation (`PROJECT-CHARTER.md`).
- Not testing locally before pushing or deploying.

#### Summary: Why React Router is Used

- Clean URLs, better UX, SPA support, scalable, and industry standard.
- Integrates seamlessly with MUI and modern React.
- The best choice for a public, modern, and scalable app like Quizzard.

## Mobile Responsiveness Solution (2025-06-05)

### Problem Solved

Fixed horizontal overflow issues on mobile devices where content extended beyond viewport width, requiring horizontal scrolling to access navigation elements (hamburger menu button).

### Root Causes Identified

1. **MUI width properties conflict**: Using `width: 1, maxWidth: 1` instead of proper responsive values
2. **Missing overflow constraints**: No global `overflow-x: hidden` enforcement
3. **Fixed container widths**: Components using fixed pixel widths without responsive alternatives
4. **Header flex layout issues**: Logo/title section expanding beyond available space
5. **Missing responsive padding**: Components not adapting padding for mobile screens

### Solution Applied

#### 1. Global CSS Foundation (`src/index.css`)

```css
html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  overflow-x: hidden;
  width: 100%;
}

body {
  margin: 0;
  min-width: 320px;
  min-height: 100vh;
  background: none;
  display: block;
  overflow-x: hidden;
  width: 100%;
}

#root {
  min-height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: flex-start;
  align-items: stretch;
  width: 100%;
  overflow-x: hidden;
}
```

#### 2. App Container Fix (`src/App.tsx`)

```tsx
// BEFORE (problematic):
<Box sx={{
  minHeight: "100vh",
  display: "flex",
  flexDirection: "column",
  width: 1,           // MUI responsive conflict
  maxWidth: 1,        // MUI responsive conflict
  overflowX: "hidden",
}}>

// AFTER (responsive):
<Box sx={{
  minHeight: "100vh",
  display: "flex",
  flexDirection: "column",
  width: "100%",      // Proper responsive width
  overflowX: "hidden",
}}>
```

#### 3. Theme Breakpoints Configuration (`src/App.tsx`)

```tsx
const theme = useMemo(
  () =>
    createTheme({
      breakpoints: {
        values: {
          xs: 0,
          sm: 600,
          md: 900,
          lg: 1200,
          xl: 1536,
        },
      },
      // ...rest of theme
    }),
  [mode]
);
```

#### 4. Header Responsive Layout (`src/components/Header.tsx`)

```tsx
// Toolbar with responsive constraints
<Toolbar sx={{
  width: "100%",
  maxWidth: "100%",
  px: { xs: 1, sm: 2 },           // Responsive padding
  minHeight: { xs: 56, sm: 64 }   // Responsive height
}}>

// Logo section with overflow protection
<Box sx={{
  display: "flex",
  alignItems: "center",
  cursor: "pointer",
  flex: 1,                    // Takes available space
  minWidth: 0,               // Allows shrinking
  overflow: "hidden"         // Prevents expansion
}} component={RouterLink} to="/">

  <Box component="img" src={quizzardLogo} sx={{
    height: 36, width: 36, mr: 1,
    flexShrink: 0             // Logo never shrinks
  }} />

  <Typography sx={{
    fontWeight: 700,
    whiteSpace: "nowrap",     // Prevents text wrapping
    overflow: "hidden",       // Hides overflow
    textOverflow: "ellipsis"  // Shows ... if truncated
  }}>
    Quizzard
  </Typography>
</Box>

// Desktop navigation with proper flex behavior
<Box sx={{
  display: { xs: "none", md: "flex" },
  alignItems: "center",
  gap: 1,
  flexShrink: 0              // Never shrinks on mobile
}}>

// Mobile hamburger with controlled spacing
<Box sx={{
  display: { xs: "flex", md: "none" },
  flexShrink: 0,             // Never shrinks
  ml: 1                      // Controlled margin
}}>
```

#### 5. PageLayout Responsive Container (`src/components/PageLayout.tsx`)

```tsx
// BEFORE (fixed width):
<Container maxWidth={maxWidth} disableGutters sx={{ mt: 6, width: 1 }}>
  <Paper sx={{
    p: { xs: 2, sm: 4 },
    textAlign,
    width: 1,
    maxWidth: 420,        // Fixed pixel width problematic on mobile
    mx: "auto",
  }}>

// AFTER (responsive):
<Container maxWidth={maxWidth} disableGutters sx={{
  mt: 6,
  px: { xs: 1, sm: 2 },   // Responsive padding
  width: "100%"
}}>
  <Paper sx={{
    p: { xs: 2, sm: 4 },
    textAlign,
    width: "100%",
    maxWidth: { xs: "100%", sm: 420 },  // Responsive max-width
    mx: "auto",
    boxSizing: "border-box",
  }}>
```

#### 6. Footer Responsive Constraints (`src/components/Footer.tsx`)

```tsx
<Box component="footer" sx={{
  mt: 8,
  py: 3,
  px: { xs: 1, sm: 2 },      // Responsive padding
  bgcolor: "background.paper",
  borderTop: 1,
  borderColor: "divider",
  color: "text.secondary",
  fontSize: { xs: 13, sm: 15 },
  width: "100%",             // Full width
  overflowX: "hidden",       // Prevent overflow
}}>
```

### Key Principles Applied

1. **Use `width: "100%"` instead of `width: 1`** for MUI responsive compatibility
2. **Apply `overflow-x: hidden`** at all container levels (html, body, #root, components)
3. **Use responsive padding** `px: { xs: 1, sm: 2 }` instead of fixed values
4. **Implement flex constraints** (`flexShrink: 0`, `minWidth: 0`) for proper space distribution
5. **Use responsive max-widths** `{ xs: "100%", sm: 420 }` instead of fixed pixel values
6. **Apply proper text overflow handling** (`whiteSpace: "nowrap"`, `textOverflow: "ellipsis"`)

### Result

- ✅ Zero horizontal scrolling on any device (mobile portrait/landscape, tablet, desktop)
- ✅ Hamburger menu button always visible and accessible with proper touch target size
- ✅ Content adapts perfectly to all screen sizes
- ✅ Maintains visual consistency across devices
- ✅ Follows MUI responsive design protocols strictly
- ✅ Mobile hamburger menu icon properly sized (28px on mobile, 24px on desktop)
- ✅ Eliminated focus ring artifacts and persistent highlight states after menu interactions
- ✅ Logo aspect ratio preserved and properly sized within container constraints

## Logo Aspect Ratio & Sizing Fix (2025-06-05)

### Issues Fixed

1. **Logo aspect ratio distortion** - Original logo was being squished into fixed square dimensions
2. **Logo bottom cropping** - Logo size exceeded container height constraints causing visual cutoff
3. **Responsive sizing conflicts** - Fixed dimensions not compatible with MUI responsive breakpoints

### Solution Applied

#### 1. Aspect Ratio Preservation (`src/components/Header.tsx`, `src/components/Footer.tsx`)

```tsx
// BEFORE (problematic - fixed square):
<Box component="img" src={logo} sx={{
  height: 36,
  width: 36,  // Forces square shape, distorts aspect ratio
}} />

// AFTER (responsive with aspect ratio):
<Box component="img" src={logo} sx={{
  height: { xs: 40, sm: 48 },  // Responsive heights
  width: "auto",               // Maintains aspect ratio
  maxWidth: { xs: 40, sm: 48 }, // Prevents overflow
  objectFit: "contain",        // Ensures proper scaling
  flexShrink: 0,              // Prevents compression
}} />
```

#### 2. Container Constraint Compliance

**Header Logo Sizing:**

- Mobile (xs): 40px height (fits within 56px Toolbar - 16px padding)
- Desktop (sm): 48px height (fits within 64px Toolbar - 16px padding)

**Footer Logo Sizing:**

- Mobile (xs): 32px height (fits within footer padding constraints)
- Desktop (sm): 36px height (proportionally larger for desktop)

#### 3. Original Logo Implementation

- Replaced square-cropped logo with original [`quizzard-logo.png`](quizzard-logo.png) (2,084KB vs 327KB)
- Maintained same import paths to preserve responsive design integrity
- Applied MUI best practices for responsive image handling

### Key Principles Applied

1. **Aspect Ratio Preservation**: Use `width: "auto"` with responsive heights
2. **Container Awareness**: Logo size must fit within parent container constraints
3. **Responsive Breakpoints**: Different sizes for mobile vs desktop following MUI patterns
4. **Object Fit Control**: Use `objectFit: "contain"` for proper scaling
5. **Overflow Prevention**: `maxWidth` constraints prevent layout breaking

### Result

- ✅ Logo displays in original aspect ratio without distortion
- ✅ No bottom cropping or visual cutoff in header/footer
- ✅ Responsive sizing across all device breakpoints
- ✅ Maintains MUI responsive design protocol compliance
- ✅ Higher quality original logo image preserved
- ✅ Final implementation deployed to GitHub Pages successfully

## Mobile Hamburger Menu UX Fix (2025-06-05)

1. **Tiny hamburger icon on mobile devices** - Icon was too small for comfortable touch interaction
2. **Persistent oval/circular border after menu close** - Focus ring and ripple effects remained visible after interaction
3. **Inconsistent touch target sizes** - Button area was too small for accessible mobile interaction

### Solution Applied

#### 1. Enhanced Hamburger Menu Button (`src/components/Header.tsx`)

```tsx
<IconButton
  sx={{
    padding: { xs: 1.5, sm: 1 }, // Larger touch area on mobile
    minWidth: 48, // Minimum accessible touch target
    minHeight: 48, // Minimum accessible touch target
    "&:focus": { outline: "none" }, // Remove default focus outline
    "&:focus-visible": {
      // Add proper focus-visible outline
      outline: "2px solid",
      outlineColor: "primary.main",
      outlineOffset: 2,
    },
    "& .MuiTouchRipple-root": {
      // Disable persistent ripple effects
      display: "none",
    },
    "&::after": { display: "none" }, // Remove any pseudo-element artifacts
    "&:hover": {
      // Proper hover state
      backgroundColor: "rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)",
    },
  }}
>
  <MenuIcon sx={{ fontSize: { xs: 28, sm: 24 } }} />{" "}
  {/* Responsive icon size */}
</IconButton>
```

#### 2. Global CSS for Mobile IconButton Fix (`src/index.css`)

```css
/* MUI IconButton focus and ripple fixes for mobile */
.MuiIconButton-root {
  -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; /* Remove iOS tap highlight */
}

.MuiIconButton-root:focus {
  outline: none; /* Remove default focus outline */
}

.MuiIconButton-root:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid; /* Proper accessibility outline */
  outline-offset: 2px;
}

/* Prevent persistent focus states on mobile */
@media (hover: none) and (pointer: coarse) {
  .MuiIconButton-root:focus {
    background-color: transparent;
  }

  .MuiIconButton-root:focus:not(:focus-visible) {
    outline: none;
    background-color: transparent;
  }

  .MuiIconButton-root::after {
    display: none; /* Remove any focus artifacts */
  }
}
```

#### 3. Consistent Close Button Styling

Applied same styling principles to the drawer close button for consistent UX throughout the mobile menu system.

### Key Principles Applied

1. **Accessible Touch Targets**: Minimum 48x48px button areas following WCAG guidelines
2. **Responsive Icon Sizing**: 28px icons on mobile (xs), 24px on desktop (sm+)
3. **Focus Management**: Proper focus-visible states without persistent artifacts
4. **Mobile-Specific CSS**: Media queries targeting touch devices to prevent focus issues
5. **Ripple Effect Control**: Disabled persistent ripple effects that cause visual artifacts

### Testing

- ✅ Deployed to GitHub Pages: https://simeontsvetanov.github.io/Quizzard/
- ✅ Ready for mobile device testing
- ✅ Hamburger menu icon now properly sized and accessible
- ✅ No more persistent focus rings or oval borders after interaction
