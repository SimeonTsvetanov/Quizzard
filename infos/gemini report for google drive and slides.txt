Quizzard PWA: Enhancing Data Persistence and Presentation with Robust Google Workspace Integration
Executive Summary
This report outlines a comprehensive architectural and implementation strategy for the Quizzard Progressive Web App (PWA), transitioning from a solely IndexedDB-based data storage model to a robust, Google Drive-centric hybrid cloud-local approach. The core principle of this new architecture is to prioritize Google Drive for all quiz data and associated multimedia storage, ensuring seamless cross-device access and robust backups. IndexedDB will serve as a critical offline-first fallback and local cache, guaranteeing uninterrupted user experience even without internet connectivity. When online, the application will intelligently synchronize local changes to Google Drive, ensuring data consistency and reliability.
A key focus is on a transparent and professional user experience. Upon first launch, users will be presented with an explicit consent prompt, clearly explaining that Google Drive integration is necessary for cross-device synchronization and export functionality, and that opting out will limit the app to local-only mode. The application will feature dedicated "Login" and "Logout" sections in the menu, and a prominent on-screen prompt will inform users if they are not logged into their Google profile. Granular synchronization settings (e.g., "only on Wi-Fi" or "always") will be provided. All data operations, including file uploads and updates, will leverage Google Drive's resumable upload capabilities for enhanced reliability. Each quiz will be meticulously organized within the user's Google Drive in a dedicated "Quizzard (quizzes database)" folder, with sub-folders for individual quizzes containing their JSON data and media. The report details the necessary Google Cloud project configurations, client-side JavaScript (React/TypeScript) implementation, required API scopes, and nuanced approaches to data synchronization, multimedia embedding, and user interface feedback, providing a clear, actionable roadmap for development for Cursor AI.
1. Introduction
1.1 Current Data Storage Challenges with IndexedDB
The initial design of the Quizzard PWA relies exclusively on IndexedDB for storing quiz data. While IndexedDB is a powerful client-side database, enabling substantial local data persistence and offline access, it presents a fundamental limitation for the application's evolving requirements: data isolation. As observed, "we can only see the details from the device its created on" [User Query]. This characteristic of IndexedDB inherently ties data to the specific browser and device where it is created and modified, thereby impeding the crucial objective of providing seamless cross-device accessibility for quiz data.
The core challenge identified is not a deficiency in IndexedDB's capability as a local storage mechanism, but rather its inherent lack of built-in synchronization across multiple user devices. To overcome this device-specific limitation and enable cross-device access, data must reside in a centralized, accessible location. A cloud service stands as the logical choice for such a centralized repository. Therefore, the architectural shift implies that a cloud service will become the primary data store, with IndexedDB transitioning to a vital role as a local cache and offline data store. This evolution is essential for user convenience and data portability.
1.2 Proposed Robust Hybrid Cloud-Local Storage Architecture
The new architectural strategy for Quizzard involves integrating Google Sign-In for robust user authentication and profile management, Google Drive for centralized storage of all quiz data and associated media (pictures, audio, video), and Google Slides for dynamically generating interactive quiz presentations. Crucially, IndexedDB will be retained as a resilient fallback mechanism, ensuring the application remains functional during offline periods [User Query]. This hybrid model directly addresses the cross-device data access limitation while preserving essential offline capabilities.
This proposed hybrid approach, while solving the cross-device problem, inherently introduces significant complexity in data synchronization and conflict resolution. These aspects must be meticulously planned and implemented to ensure absolute data integrity and a seamless user experience. The "offline-first" paradigm is not merely a feature but a foundational design principle here, where the application is designed to function smoothly offline and intelligently synchronize any changes back to the cloud when connectivity is reestablished. The transition to a distributed data model, where modifications can originate from both local IndexedDB and the cloud-based Google Drive, necessitates explicit strategies for managing data consistency.
1.3 Quizzard PWA Technical Context (React, GitHub Pages)
The Quizzard application is being developed using "cursor ai," hosted on GitHub Pages as a Progressive Web App (PWA), and leverages a React tech stack [User Query]. This technical foundation strongly emphasizes client-side JavaScript solutions and necessitates the implementation of robust PWA features, such as service workers for reliable offline support and background synchronization.
The choice of React and PWA deployment on GitHub Pages inherently dictates a strong reliance on client-side JavaScript solutions. This means that Google Identity Services' client-side libraries and the Google API Client Library (gapi.client) will be central to the implementation. While the application architecture is predominantly client-side, the secure management of long-lived tokens, such as refresh tokens, for persistent cross-device access might necessitate a minimal server-side component. This component could be implemented as a serverless function to adhere to security best practices for token exchange.1 The inability to securely store client secrets in a purely client-side environment makes a backend component for refresh token handling a critical security consideration, ensuring that sensitive credentials are not exposed.12
2. Google Identity Services Integration: Authentication & User State Management
This section details the robust implementation of Google Sign-In, ensuring a secure and seamless user experience from login to persistent session management.
2.1 OAuth 2.0 and Google Identity Services for Web
OAuth 2.0 serves as the industry-standard protocol for secure authorization, enabling applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service. For Quizzard, OAuth 2.0 will facilitate secure access to Google Drive and Google Slides APIs on behalf of the user, without requiring the application to handle user credentials directly.
Google Identity Services (GIS) represents the modern and recommended approach for integrating Google Sign-In and authorization into web applications, superseding older Google Sign-In libraries.14 GIS streamlines the user experience by providing features like One Tap sign-in and automatic sign-in prompts, while enhancing security. A key architectural distinction in GIS is the separation of user authentication and authorization into two distinct operations. The ID token, used to identify a user, is returned separately from the access token, which is used for authorization to Google APIs. This modularity improves security and allows for more granular control over user data access.
2.2 Google Cloud Project Setup and Credentials
Before implementing Google Identity Services and interacting with Google APIs, a Google Cloud Project must be properly configured. This involves several critical steps to establish the necessary credentials and permissions:
1.	Enable APIs: Within the Google Cloud Console, the Google Drive API and Google Slides API must be explicitly enabled for the project. This grants the project the necessary permissions to interact with these services.
2.	Configure OAuth Consent Screen: The OAuth consent screen dictates what information is displayed to users when they are prompted to grant access to the application. This configuration includes setting the application name (e.g., "Quizzard"), a user support email, and developer contact information. It is crucial for user trust and for Google's verification process. For a public application, the user type should be set to "External".
3.	Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Web Application): A Web application type OAuth 2.0 Client ID must be created. This client ID uniquely identifies the Quizzard PWA to Google's OAuth servers. Crucially, the "Authorized JavaScript Origins" must be configured to include the domains from which the application will send API requests (e.g., http://localhost:<port> for development, and the GitHub Pages domain for production). Client secrets are generally not used for client-side web applications, as they cannot be securely stored on the client.
4.	Create API Key (Optional but Recommended): While OAuth 2.0 credentials handle user authorization, an API key can be created for identifying the project and for services that do not require user consent. Although OAuth is the primary method for accessing user data in this context, an API key can be useful for certain unauthenticated requests or for rate limiting purposes.
2.3 Client-Side Implementation with React
The React-based PWA will implement Google Identity Services (GIS) primarily on the client-side to manage user authentication and obtain access tokens for Google APIs.
2.3.1 Loading GIS Client Library
The first step in the client-side implementation is to load the Google Identity Services client library. This is achieved by including a script tag in the HTML, typically in the <head> section, with the async and defer attributes to ensure non-blocking loading.
HTML
<script src="https://accounts.google.com/gsi/client" async defer></script>
This script provides access to the google.accounts.oauth2 object, which is central to the GIS authentication flow.
2.3.2 Token Model (Implicit Flow with PKCE considerations for Robustness)
For client-side applications like Quizzard, the Token Model (formerly known as the Implicit Flow) is often used with GIS to obtain access tokens. This model is designed for web apps that do not have a backend server to securely store client secrets or refresh tokens.15
The google.accounts.oauth2.initTokenClient() method is used to initialize a new token client with the application's client ID and the required OAuth scopes. A callback function is provided to handle the TokenResponse once the user grants consent.
JavaScript
const client = google.accounts.oauth2.initTokenClient({
  client_id: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID',
  scope: 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file https://www.googleapis.com/auth/presentations', // Example scopes
  callback: (tokenResponse) => {
    if (tokenResponse && tokenResponse.access_token) {
      // Handle the access token here
      console.log('Access Token:', tokenResponse.access_token);
      // Set the access token for gapi.client
      gapi.client.setToken(tokenResponse);
    } else {
      console.error('Failed to obtain access token:', tokenResponse.error);
    }
  },
});
The token flow is typically triggered by a user gesture, such as a button click, by calling client.requestAccessToken(). This action prompts the user to select their Google account, sign in if necessary, and grant consent for the requested scopes. Upon successful consent, Google returns a TokenResponse containing the access token and a list of scopes the user has approved.
A critical consideration for client-side applications is the handling of refresh tokens. The Token Model, by design, does not typically provide refresh tokens directly to the client for security reasons. Access tokens have a limited lifetime (typically 1 hour) 8, after which a new access token must be obtained. While the GIS library can manage access token refreshing for existing sessions without requiring a full re-authentication UI prompt, this generally relies on a persistent user session with Google.
The security implications of storing refresh tokens client-side are significant. Client-side applications cannot securely store client secrets, making them vulnerable to token theft if refresh tokens are directly exposed.12
For a completely robust solution that ensures persistent user sessions across devices without repeated prompts, even after long periods of inactivity, it is highly recommended to implement a minimal, secure backend component, such as a serverless function (e.g., Google Cloud Function). This backend would handle the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE). In this flow, the client obtains an authorization code, which is then securely exchanged with the backend for an access token and a refresh token. The backend would then be responsible for securely storing and refreshing the refresh token, providing fresh access tokens to the client as needed.
2.3.3 gapi.client Initialization and User Persistence
After obtaining an access token through Google Identity Services, the Google API Client Library for JavaScript (gapi.client) can be initialized to interact with specific Google APIs like Drive and Slides. This involves loading the client module and then initializing the client with the obtained access token and discovery documents for the desired APIs.
JavaScript
// Function called after GIS authentication and token acquisition
async function initializeGapiClient(accessToken) {
  await gapi.client.init({
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY', // Optional, primarily for unauthenticated requests
    discoveryDocs: [
      'https://www.googleapis.com/discovery/v1/apis/drive/v3/rest',
      'https://www.googleapis.com/discovery/v1/apis/slides/v1/rest'
    ],
    // The access token obtained from GIS
    // gapi.client.setToken(tokenResponse) is called in the GIS callback
  });
  console.log('Google API client initialized.');
}

// In your GIS callback after receiving tokenResponse:
// gapi.client.setToken(tokenResponse);
// gapi.load('client', () => initializeGapiClient(tokenResponse.access_token));
This setup allows subsequent calls to gapi.client.drive and gapi.client.slides to be automatically authenticated with the user's access token. To ensure the user remains logged in, the application will rely on GIS's ability to automatically refresh access tokens for existing sessions. If the user's session with Google expires or is revoked, the application will detect this and prompt for re-authentication.
2.4 Required OAuth Scopes
To define the level of access granted to the Quizzard PWA, specific authorization scopes must be identified and declared. The principle of least privilege dictates that only the most narrowly focused scopes necessary for the application's functionality should be requested. This approach enhances user trust and simplifies the verification process for public applications.
For Quizzard's functionality, the following OAuth scopes are essential:
•	https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file: This scope is highly recommended as it grants access only to files and folders that the application explicitly opens or creates. This is a non-sensitive scope, providing per-file access and limiting the application's reach to only the necessary files.24
•	https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive: This is a broader, restricted scope that grants full read/write access to all of the user's Google Drive files.
•	https://www.googleapis.com/auth/presentations: This scope grants the application permission to see, edit, create, and delete all of the user's Google Slides presentations.
When requesting multiple scopes, it is important to handle scenarios where users may not grant all requested permissions. The application should gracefully disable any functionality dependent on denied scopes and provide context to the user if a specific feature requires additional permissions.12
2.5 User Experience for Authentication and Profile Management
To ensure a robust and professional application, the user experience around Google Drive integration and synchronization must be meticulously designed.
2.5.1 Initial Onboarding & Consent Prompt
When the user opens the Quizzard PWA for the first time, they will be presented with a clear and concise onboarding prompt regarding Google Drive integration [User Query]. This prompt will explicitly state:
•	Purpose: Explain the benefits of signing in with a Google account:
o	Cross-device access: Quizzes and media will be accessible from any device where the user signs into Quizzard.
o	Automatic backups: All data will be securely stored in their personal Google Drive.
o	Export functionality: Enable Google Slides export.
o	Crucially, the prompt will inform the user: "the app will need to upload in their Google account Drive to store information" [User Query].
•	Choice and Consequences: Clearly state the implications of not signing in:
o	The app will function only locally (data stored in IndexedDB).
o	No cross-device synchronization.
o	No Google Slides export functionality.
o	"if they don't want that it will work only locally with no export functionality and only in the app" [User Query].
•	Call to Action: Provide a prominent "Sign in with Google" button. A "Continue Locally" or "Skip for now" option will also be available.
2.5.2 Navigation Menu Integration (Login/Logout)
The application's main menu (leveraging MUI components) will include dedicated "Login" and "Logout" sections [User Query].
•	"Login" (if not authenticated):
o	If the user is not currently authenticated with Google, this option will initiate the Google Sign-In flow.
o	Upon successful login, the app will attempt to synchronize data from Google Drive to IndexedDB and enable cloud-dependent features.
•	"Logout" (if authenticated):
o	This option will revoke the user's Google Drive access token and clear any Google-related session data.
o	The app will revert to local-only mode, disabling cloud-dependent features like Google Drive sync and Slides export.
o	A confirmation dialog will inform the user about the implications of logging out (e.g., data will no longer sync, access from other devices will be limited until re-login).
2.5.3 Persistent Login & Offline Prompts
To ensure a robust user experience, the app will actively manage the user's login state:
•	Keeping User Logged In: The application will leverage Google Identity Services' built-in mechanisms for managing access token lifetimes and refreshing them automatically to keep the user logged in seamlessly, as long as their Google session is active. For long-term persistence without repeated prompts, the recommended backend component for refresh token management (as detailed in 2.3.2) is essential.
•	Logged Out Prompt: "if he is logged out for some reason to prompt on screen that he is not in his profile until he joins his profile" [User Query]. A persistent, non-intrusive banner or modal will be displayed on relevant screens (e.g., quiz list, quiz editor) if the user is not logged in, clearly stating that cloud features are unavailable and prompting them to sign in.
3. Google Drive Integration for Robust Quiz Data & Media Storage
Google Drive will serve as the central repository for all Quizzard data, including quiz definitions (JSON) and associated multimedia files (pictures, audio, video). This integration is key to enabling cross-device access and robust data management.
3.1 Robust Folder Structure in Google Drive
To maintain organization and ensure a clear "database" structure within the user's Google Drive, Quizzard will implement a specific folder hierarchy [User Query]:
1.	Main Application Folder:
o	The application will first search for a top-level folder named "Quizzard (quizzes database)" in the user's Google Drive. This search is performed using gapi.client.drive.files.list with a q parameter to filter by name and MIME type (mimeType='application/vnd.google-apps.folder' and name='Quizzard (quizzes database)').39
o	If this folder does not exist, it will be programmatically created using gapi.client.drive.files.create with mimeType: 'application/vnd.google-apps.folder'.24 The ID of this main folder will be stored locally (e.g., in IndexedDB) for quick access.
2.	Individual Quiz Folders:
o	Inside the "Quizzard (quizzes database)" folder, a separate sub-folder will be created for each quiz [User Query].
o	The name of this sub-folder will be the Quiz.title (quiz name) [User Query].
o	When a new quiz is created, or an existing local-only quiz is first synced, the application will create this dedicated folder using files.create, specifying the main "Quizzard (quizzes database)" folder's ID as its parent.40
3.	Quiz Contents:
o	"the quiz details inside" [User Query]: The JSON file representing the Quiz object and all its associated MediaFiles (images, audio, video) will be stored directly within this specific quiz's sub-folder.
3.2 Robust Quiz Data Storage (JSON files)
Quiz data, encompassing questions, options, answers, and metadata, will be stored as JSON files within each quiz's dedicated folder. This structured format allows for easy parsing and manipulation within the PWA.
The process for saving quiz data involves:
1.	Serialization: Converting the JavaScript Quiz object into a JSON string using JSON.stringify().42
2.	Blob Creation: Creating a Blob object from the JSON string, specifying type: 'application/json'.45
3.	Upload/Update with Resumable Uploads:
o	New Files: For creating new quiz files, the gapi.client.drive.files.create method is used. For smaller JSON files, a multipart upload can be utilized, combining both metadata (name, parent folder ID, MIME type) and the file content (the Blob) in a single request.
o	Existing Files: To update an existing quiz file, the gapi.client.drive.files.update method is employed, referencing the file's ID. This method also supports multipart or, crucially, resumable uploads for updating content.
o	Resumable Uploads for Robustness: For all quiz JSON files (and especially media), uploadType=resumable is the recommended upload type. This protocol allows uploads to be paused and resumed, saving bandwidth and time in case of interruptions, and ensuring "completely robust" saving.
3.2.1 Versioning and Conflict Resolution for Quizzes
To know "which is the newest version" and handle conflicts [User Query], Quizzard will leverage Google Drive's native capabilities and a robust client-side strategy:
•	Google Drive's modifiedTime: Every file in Google Drive has a modifiedTime metadata field, which is automatically updated by Drive on every content modification. This timestamp will serve as the authoritative indicator of the latest version on the cloud.59
•	Quiz updatedAt Field: The Quiz TypeScript interface already includes an updatedAt: Date field. This field will be updated every time a quiz is edited in the Quizzard application.
•	Conflict Detection: During synchronization, if a quiz file exists in both IndexedDB and Google Drive, their respective updatedAt (from local JSON) and modifiedTime (from Drive metadata) timestamps will be compared. If both have changed since the last known sync, a conflict is detected.
•	Conflict Resolution ("Last Write Wins"): The recommended strategy is "Last Write Wins". The version with the most recent timestamp (either Quiz.updatedAt from local or Drive's modifiedTime) will be considered the authoritative version and will overwrite the older one. This is a common and pragmatic approach for PWA synchronization.
3.3 Uploading Media Files (Pictures, Audio, Video)
Quizzes often include multimedia elements. These files will also be stored in each quiz's dedicated Google Drive folder. The process for uploading media files is similar to that for JSON files, with a strong emphasis on resumable uploads due to potentially larger file sizes.
1.	File Input & Blob Conversion: Users will select media files (pictures, audio, video) through standard HTML file input elements. The selected File objects are a type of Blob and can be directly used for uploads, or converted from Base64 strings if necessary (e.g., for images generated client-side).45
2.	Resumable Uploads: For all media files, especially videos and high-resolution images, uploadType=resumable is the recommended upload type. This ensures robust uploads, particularly from mobile devices or unstable networks.
3.	MIME Types: Correct MIME types must be specified for each media file (e.g., image/jpeg, audio/mp3, video/mp4) during the upload process.26
4.	Permissions for Embedding (Secure Access): For embedding media into Google Slides, the application will obtain a temporary, authenticated webContentLink or webViewLink via the Drive API's files.get method.69 This link is valid for a limited time and is tied to the authenticated user's session, ensuring privacy and security without making the original file publicly shared.
3.4 Storage Space Management
A crucial aspect of managing user data in Google Drive is monitoring available storage space. The user explicitly requested checking for available space before every change [User Query].
The Drive API provides the gapi.client.drive.about.get method, which can retrieve information about the user's storage quota and usage. By specifying fields='storageQuota', the application can obtain details such as usage, usageInDrive, usageInDriveTrash, and limit (if applicable).
JavaScript
async function checkDriveSpace() {
  try {
    const response = await gapi.client.drive.about.get({
      fields: 'storageQuota'
    });
    const storageQuota = response.result.storageQuota;
    const totalUsage = parseInt(storageQuota.usage);
    const storageLimit = parseInt(storageQuota.limit); // Will be undefined if unlimited
    
    console.log('Total used space:', totalUsage, 'bytes');
    if (storageLimit) {
      console.log('Storage limit:', storageLimit, 'bytes');
      const availableSpace = storageLimit - totalUsage;
      console.log('Available space:', availableSpace, 'bytes');
      return availableSpace;
    } else {
      console.log('User has unlimited storage or limit not provided.');
      return Infinity; // Indicate effectively unlimited space
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error checking Drive space:', error);
    // Handle error, e.g., assume limited space or notify user
    return 0; // Return 0 to prevent large uploads if space check fails
  }
}
Before initiating large uploads (e.g., new quizzes with multiple media files), Quizzard will call this function to assess available space. If the available space falls below a predefined threshold or if a storageQuotaExceeded error is encountered during an upload, the application will:
•	Notify the user about low storage.
•	Suggest clearing old quizzes or media files.
•	Potentially offer options to upgrade their Google Drive storage plan.
•	Prevent further large uploads until space is freed or upgraded.
•	Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for rate limit errors.
4. Data Synchronization Strategy: Google Drive First with Robust Fallback
The hybrid architecture necessitates a robust data synchronization strategy to ensure data consistency between the local IndexedDB and the cloud-based Google Drive, while maintaining a seamless user experience, especially during offline periods. The user explicitly stated the need for the app to "always prioritize the Google Drive only when no internet then to fallback to local storage and then if we go back online to update there" [User Query]. This defines a Network-First with Local Fallback for Writes strategy.
4.1 Offline-First Principles
The Quizzard PWA will adhere to offline-first principles, prioritizing local data access and functionality even when network connectivity is unavailable or unreliable. This means the application is designed to function as if it is always online, with synchronization occurring in the background.
Service Workers play a pivotal role in enabling offline capabilities and background synchronization. They act as a proxy between the application and the network, intercepting requests, caching resources, and managing data updates even when the main application thread is not active. This ensures that users can continue creating and editing quizzes regardless of their network status.
4.2 Synchronization Algorithm: Google Drive First
The synchronization algorithm will prioritize Google Drive as the source of truth, with IndexedDB serving as a local, always-available replica and an "outbox" for offline changes.
4.2.1 Initial Load/Online Sync
Upon the application's initial load or when it regains internet connectivity:
1.	Check Network Status: The application will first check navigator.onLine to determine connectivity.
2.	Prioritize Google Drive (if online): If online, the application will attempt to fetch the latest quiz data and media metadata directly from Google Drive.
o	Fetch Changes from Google Drive: Instead of downloading all quiz data, the application will efficiently track changes using the Drive API's changes.list method. This method provides an efficient way to detect changes to items in Drive since a given point in time.59 A 
startPageToken is used to get the current state of the user's Drive, and subsequent calls use the nextPageToken to fetch only new changes. This significantly reduces bandwidth and improves performance compared to full data downloads.
o	Reconcile with IndexedDB: The fetched changes from Google Drive will be compared with the existing data in IndexedDB. Any new or updated quiz files and media metadata found in Drive will be used to update or insert corresponding records in IndexedDB. Conversely, if a quiz or media file is deleted in Drive, it should be marked for deletion or removed from IndexedDB.
3.	Fallback to IndexedDB (if offline or Drive sync fails): If the application is offline, or if the initial Google Drive sync fails (e.g., due to network issues or API errors), the application will load the most recent data available from IndexedDB.
4.2.2 Offline Modifications
When the user is offline or experiences intermittent connectivity, all quiz data modifications (create, update, delete) will first be applied directly to IndexedDB. To ensure these changes are eventually synchronized with Google Drive, they will be queued in a dedicated "outbox" object store within IndexedDB. Each queued item will contain the necessary data and metadata to perform the corresponding Google Drive API operation (e.g., file content, file ID, operation type like CREATE, UPDATE, or DELETE).
4.2.3 Background Synchronization (when online)
The Background Sync API, exposed through the Service Worker, is crucial for automatically synchronizing offline changes when network connectivity is restored.
1.	Register Sync Event: When an offline modification occurs and is queued in IndexedDB, the application will register a one-off background sync event using navigator.serviceWorker.ready.sync.register('sync-quizzard-data'). This tells the browser to trigger a 'sync' event in the Service Worker as soon as a stable network connection becomes available.
2.	Process Queued Changes: Within the Service Worker's 'sync' event listener, the queued changes from the IndexedDB "outbox" will be retrieved. For each queued item, the corresponding Google Drive API operation (create, update, or delete file) will be executed.
3.	Clean Up: Upon successful completion of an API operation for a queued item, that item will be removed from the IndexedDB "outbox". This ensures that only pending changes are retained and re-attempted if the sync fails.
4.3 Synchronization Settings: "Always" vs. "Only on Wi-Fi"
To provide a professional and user-friendly experience, Quizzard will offer a setting for synchronization preferences [User Query].
•	"Sync Data: Always" (Default): This will be the default setting. When enabled, the application will attempt to synchronize data with Google Drive whenever online, regardless of network type (Wi-Fi or cellular). Background sync will be utilized for offline changes.
•	"Sync Data: Only on Wi-Fi": When this option is selected, the application will restrict large data uploads (e.g., media files, initial full quiz syncs) to Google Drive only when a Wi-Fi connection is detected.
o	Implementation Note: Directly detecting "Wi-Fi" vs. "cellular" in PWAs can be challenging and is not universally reliable across all browsers and devices using navigator.connection.type. A robust approach for this setting would involve:
	Heuristic-based detection: Use navigator.connection.type if available, but acknowledge its limitations.
	User-informed choice: Clearly communicate to the user that selecting "Only on Wi-Fi" means large uploads might be delayed until a stable, potentially unmetered, connection is detected, or until they manually trigger a sync.
	Prioritize critical data: Even on cellular, small, critical updates (e.g., quiz metadata changes) could still be prioritized for immediate sync to minimize data loss, while large media uploads are deferred.
	User notification: Inform the user if a sync is pending due to network type restrictions.
4.4 Conflict Resolution Strategies
Data conflicts can arise when the same piece of quiz data is modified independently in IndexedDB (offline) and in Google Drive (potentially from another device or directly in the Drive UI). Effective conflict resolution is paramount to maintaining data consistency and preventing data loss.
For Quizzard, a "Last Write Wins" strategy is recommended as a pragmatic starting point, given the complexity of merging rich quiz data.
•	Mechanism: Each quiz data object (JSON file) and media file will include a lastModified timestamp (for local IndexedDB records) and Google Drive's modifiedTime metadata. During synchronization, if a conflict is detected (i.e., the same file has been modified in both local and cloud versions), the version with the most recent timestamp is accepted as the authoritative version, overwriting the older one.
•	User Communication: To mitigate potential silent data loss, the application will provide clear visual cues and notifications:
o	Sync Status: Display "Syncing...", "Offline Mode", "Online", "Sync Complete", "Sync Failed", "Conflicts Detected".45
o	Conflict Notification: If a "Last Write Wins" conflict occurs, a subtle notification (e.g., a toast message or a small icon) will inform the user that a newer version of a quiz was synchronized, potentially overwriting local changes. For critical data, a more explicit warning might be considered.
o	Last Synced Timestamp: Displaying "Last Synced:" in the UI helps users understand data freshness.45
It is paramount to implement robust error handling for all IndexedDB operations and Google API calls. This includes handling QuotaExceededError for IndexedDB, network errors, and API-specific error responses, ensuring the application remains stable and provides informative feedback to the user.
4.5 UI Feedback for Synchronization Status
To provide immediate and clear feedback to the user, the Quizzard application will incorporate visual indicators on the quizzes screen:
•	Cloud Icon: On the quizzes screen, next to each quiz entry, a small cloud icon will be displayed [User Query]. This icon will dynamically change to reflect the synchronization status of that specific quiz:
o	Cloud with Checkmark (Synced): Indicates the quiz is fully synchronized with Google Drive.
o	Cloud with Arrows (Syncing): Indicates the quiz is currently undergoing synchronization.
o	Cloud with Exclamation Mark (Conflict/Error): Indicates a synchronization error or a detected conflict for that quiz. Clicking this icon could reveal more details or options to resolve.
o	Cloud with Slash (Local Only): Indicates the quiz is only stored locally and is not synchronized with Google Drive (e.g., if the user is logged out or opted for local-only mode).
•	Global Status Indicator: A persistent status bar or icon in the application header/footer will provide a global overview of the overall sync status (e.g., "Online," "Offline," "Syncing All Quizzes," "Sync Errors Detected").45
5. Google Slides Presentation Generation
