# 05.01.02 - Quiz Creation Wizard

## Objective

To implement a streamlined, mobile-optimized two-step quiz creation wizard with auto-save, draft persistence, and robust deletion functionality.

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Two-Step Creation Process

*   **Description:** Implement a streamlined basic info collection (title, description, time settings) followed by rounds/questions management.
*   **Verification:** Navigate through the wizard steps and ensure data is carried over correctly.

### 2. Floating Action Button System

*   **Description:** Implement Edit Quiz (pen icon) and Save Quiz (save icon) with responsive desktop text + mobile icon-only design.
*   **Verification:** Test button responsiveness and functionality on different screen sizes.

### 3. Draft Auto-Save System

*   **Description:** Implement automatic draft persistence every 30 seconds with IndexedDB storage and recovery functionality.
*   **Verification:** Create a quiz, make changes, close and reopen the app/browser, and verify changes are saved.

### 4. Lenient Validation System

*   **Description:** Implement validation that only requires quiz title, allowing saving incomplete quizzes for later completion.
*   **Verification:** Attempt to save a quiz with only a title and verify it's allowed.

### 5. Delete Functionality

*   **Description:** Integrate delete quiz option with confirmation dialog in edit mode only (trash bin icon on basic info step).
*   **Verification:** Test deleting a quiz from within the wizard and confirm the dialog appears and deletion works.

### 6. Cross-Session Recovery

*   **Description:** Ensure reliable draft persistence across browser sessions with IndexedDB reliability.
*   **Verification:** Create a draft, close the browser entirely, reopen, and verify the draft is still present.

### 7. Mobile-Optimized Wizard

*   **Description:** Ensure touch-friendly controls, responsive layouts, and mobile-first design principles.
*   **Verification:** Test the wizard on mobile devices for usability and visual consistency.

## Expected Outcome & Verification

*   A functional two-step quiz creation wizard is available.
*   Quizzes are automatically saved as drafts.
*   Users can delete quizzes from within the wizard.
*   The wizard is fully responsive and mobile-friendly.
