# 05.01.04 - Error Handling & UX Enhancements

## Objective

To ensure robust error handling, data recovery, and a professional, mobile-optimized user experience throughout the quiz creation and management process.

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Global Error Boundaries

*   **Description:** Implement React error boundaries to catch and handle component crashes gracefully.
*   **Verification:** Introduce a simulated error in a component and verify that the error boundary catches it and displays a fallback UI.

### 2. Graceful Degradation

*   **Description:** Ensure features continue working even when IndexedDB or localStorage fail.
*   **Verification:** Simulate storage failures (e.g., disable IndexedDB in browser settings) and verify the app remains functional with appropriate warnings.

### 3. User-Friendly Messages

*   **Description:** All errors display helpful messages with recovery suggestions.
*   **Verification:** Review all error messages for clarity, helpfulness, and user-friendliness.

### 4. Offline Support

*   **Description:** Ensure quiz creation works offline with sync when connection is restored.
*   **Verification:** Go offline, create/edit a quiz, go online, and verify data consistency.

### 5. Data Recovery Systems

*   **Description:** Implement multiple fallbacks to ensure no user data loss during errors.
*   **Verification:** Test various scenarios that could lead to data loss (e.g., browser crash during save) and verify data recovery mechanisms.

### 6. Debug Logging

*   **Description:** Implement a comprehensive logging system for development troubleshooting.
*   **Verification:** Verify that relevant actions and errors are logged to the console during development.

### 7. Mobile-Optimized Interface

*   **Description:** Ensure responsive design with touch-friendly controls, proper spacing, and mobile-specific layouts.
*   **Verification:** Conduct thorough testing on various mobile devices and screen sizes.

### 8. Professional Navigation

*   **Description:** Implement fixed bottom navigation in wizard with step indicators, back/forward controls, and cancel/complete actions.
*   **Verification:** Test navigation flow within the wizard, ensuring all controls work as expected.

### 9. Visual Feedback System

*   **Description:** Implement loading states, success/error notifications, and comprehensive status indicators throughout the interface.
*   **Verification:** Observe UI feedback during async operations (e.g., saving, loading) and for success/error states.

### 10. Accessibility Compliance

*   **Description:** Ensure full ARIA label implementation, keyboard navigation support, and screen reader compatibility.
*   **Verification:** Perform accessibility audits using browser tools and screen readers.

### 11. Progressive Enhancement

*   **Description:** Core functionality works on all devices, enhanced features on capable devices.
*   **Verification:** Test on older/less capable devices to ensure core features remain functional.

### 12. Performance Optimization

*   **Description:** Ensure fast loading, efficient rendering, and minimal memory usage.
*   **Verification:** Use browser performance tools to monitor loading times, rendering performance, and memory usage.

## Expected Outcome & Verification

*   The quiz creation and management process is resilient to errors.
*   User data is protected against loss.
*   The UI provides clear feedback and is highly usable on mobile devices.
*   The application performs efficiently.

## Relevant Files

*   `src/shared/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`
*   `src/features/quizzes/` (various components and hooks for UI/UX)
*   `src/features/quizzes/management/services/indexedDBService.ts` (for storage failure handling)

## Edge Cases & Considerations

*   Consider how to handle very large quizzes that might impact performance or storage limits.
*   Ensure consistent error reporting across different parts of the application.
