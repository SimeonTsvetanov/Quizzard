# 05.01.01 - Core Architecture & IndexedDB Storage

## Objective

To establish the core architecture for the Quizzes feature, focusing on modularity, professional code organization, and robust IndexedDB storage implementation.

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Feature-Based Architecture

*   **Description:** Ensure the complete modular structure with `creation-editing/`, `management/`, `exporting/`, `playing/`, `types/`, and `services/` modules is in place.
*   **Verification:** Verify the directory structure under `src/features/quizzes/` matches the defined architecture.

### 2. IndexedDB Storage Implementation

*   **Description:** Implement full IndexedDB integration with draft persistence, auto-save functionality, and storage monitoring via `indexedDBService.ts`.
*   **Verification:** Confirm `indexedDBService.ts` exists and handles CRUD operations for quizzes. Test auto-save and draft recovery.

### 3. Professional Code Organization

*   **Description:** Maintain clean architecture with TypeScript files implementing Single Responsibility Principle and comprehensive JSDoc documentation.
*   **Verification:** Review code for adherence to SRP, JSDoc presence, and overall organization.

### 4. Time Input System Overhaul

*   **Description:** Convert time input from slider-based seconds to number input minutes (1 minute default, supports decimal values 0.5-60 minutes with validation).
*   **Verification:** Test time input component with various valid and invalid inputs.

### 5. Responsive Material-UI Design

*   **Description:** Ensure full MUI implementation with theme support, mobile-first design, and accessibility compliance.
*   **Verification:** Visually inspect UI on different screen sizes and check for accessibility attributes.

### 6. Error Boundary Integration

*   **Description:** Integrate robust error handling system with graceful fallbacks and user-friendly error messages across all quiz components.
*   **Verification:** Test error scenarios to ensure graceful degradation and proper error messages.

### 7. SPA Architecture Compliance

*   **Description:** Ensure full React Router integration with clean URLs, browser navigation support, and GitHub Pages SPA compatibility.
*   **Verification:** Test routing, direct URL access, and browser back/forward functionality.

## Expected Outcome & Verification

*   The `src/features/quizzes/` directory is well-structured and organized.
*   IndexedDB is used for local quiz data persistence with auto-save.
*   Time input for quizzes is in minutes with proper validation.
*   The UI is responsive and follows Material-UI guidelines.
*   Error boundaries are integrated for graceful error handling.
*   SPA routing works correctly.

## Relevant Files

*   `src/features/quizzes/` (all subdirectories and files)
*   `src/features/quizzes/services/indexedDBService.ts`
*   `src/features/quizzes/types/index.ts`
*   `src/App.tsx` (for error boundary and routing context)

## Edge Cases & Considerations

*   Ensure IndexedDB schema is versioned for future migrations.
*   Consider performance implications of frequent IndexedDB writes for auto-save.
