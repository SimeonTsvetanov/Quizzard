# 05.01.03 - Question Management System

## Objective

To implement a comprehensive question management system within the quiz creation wizard, supporting various question types, dynamic editing, and robust navigation.

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Round-Based Architecture

*   **Description:** Organize questions into rounds with individual settings (description, type, time limits, answer reveal modes).
*   **Verification:** Create multiple rounds and verify that questions are correctly associated with their respective rounds.

### 2. Question Types Support

*   **Description:** Implement multiple choice, single answer, and extensible type system ready for media integration.
*   **Verification:** Test creating questions of different types (multiple choice, single answer) and ensure their unique properties are handled.

### 3. Dynamic Question Editor

*   **Description:** Implement real-time question editing with answer management, point assignment, and time overrides.
*   **Verification:** Edit existing questions, change answers, points, and time limits, and verify changes are reflected immediately.

### 4. Navigation System

*   **Description:** Implement round navigation with add/edit/delete operations and question list management.
*   **Verification:** Add, edit, and delete rounds and questions, ensuring smooth navigation and correct list updates.

### 5. Validation System

*   **Description:** Implement real-time validation with user-friendly error messages and warning indicators.
*   **Verification:** Test invalid inputs (e.g., empty question text, incorrect answer format) and verify appropriate error messages are displayed.

### 6. Accessibility Compliance

*   **Description:** Ensure full ARIA label support, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility.
*   **Verification:** Test with keyboard navigation and screen reader tools to ensure all elements are accessible.

## Expected Outcome & Verification

*   Users can create and manage questions within rounds.
*   Different question types are supported and editable.
*   Navigation between rounds and questions is intuitive.
*   Validation provides real-time feedback.
*   The system is accessible.

*   `src/features/quizzes/creation-editing/steps/hooks/` (Step-specific state management)
*   `src/features/quizzes/types/index.ts` (Question and Round type definitions)

## Edge Cases & Considerations

*   Ensure media integration (when implemented) works seamlessly with question types.
*   Consider performance for quizzes with a very large number of questions/rounds.
