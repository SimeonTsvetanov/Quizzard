# GOOGLE AUTHENTICATION ENHANCEMENT PLAN

## 🎯 WHY WE NEED THIS

Our current Google authentication system has several limitations that impact user experience:

1. **Token Expiration Issues**: Users are logged out every hour due to token expiration, even when actively using the app
2. **Storage Reliability**: Auth tokens stored in localStorage can be lost when browser data is cleared
3. **No Offline Handling**: No graceful degradation when Google services are unavailable
4. **Poor Error Messages**: Users don't understand why authentication fails
5. **No Background Sync**: No automatic token refresh to maintain persistent sessions

This plan addresses these issues while maintaining 100% backward compatibility and zero UI changes.
